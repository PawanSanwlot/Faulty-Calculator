# Special Calculator

**Special Calculator** is a web-based calculator with a sleek, dark-themed user interface and smooth animations. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this calculator features unique arithmetic logic: for each operator, there is a 10% chance that a different operation will be performed. Enjoy a modern twist on standard calculator functionality!

- **Footer:** A simple footer with copyright.
